# Summary

This series of interactive Python notebooks has hopefully given you another way to relate the maths you have seen in CMP502 and CMP505 to the visual effect or how to implement it in code.. 

Some workbooks have demonstrated how Python achieves the same solutions as those found by hand, solved through symbolic computation. Other workbooks saw a practical implementation of the mathematics, illustrating animations of dynamic behaviour underpinned by the maths introduced in lectures. After you have completed your courses, you will likely use codes (potentially even Python!) to perform much of this mathematics for you, often without even realising. I hope that these interactive tools provide insight about how fundamental this mathematics is in many areas of computer games technology.
