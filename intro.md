# Welcome

This is a collection of Python Jupyter notebooks, designed to complement content mathematics teaching covered in two modules, CMP502 and CMP505, as part of the Masters program for Computer Games Technology (CGT) students at Abertay University.

CMP502 and CMP505 showcases mathematics which underpins various aspects of CGT. The routines demonstrated here illustrate how Python (and other computational languages) can be used to see this mathematics in action. 

The mathematics strands of CMP502 and CMP505 courses are designed to enhance mathematics understanding; these notebooks are not a substitute for learning these mathematical tools and techniques. CMP502 and CMP505 include maths class tests which examine your understanding of the mathematical tools taught, and which should be carried out using pen and paper, not numerical code. These notebooks and routines do *NOT* replace the mathematical approaches shown in the lectures, and should not be used in the class test under any circumstances. The class test in particular has been designed to be carried out using pen and paper under significant time limitations, and hence is unlikely to be solved using these codes in the limited time available.
